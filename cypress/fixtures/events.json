In this multimedia installation on Black womanhood within the home space, Fazlalizadeh explores her childhood and adulthood within the domestic space and how it connects to the experiences of other Black women and those who had a girlhood. Using paintings, drawings, video, and reappropriated home objects, she examines her experiences of joy, rest, sadness, and fellowship in the home.

Since this time, massive casualties, human rights violations, and an unprecedented refugee crisis have ensued. Women artists of Ukraine have responded. They paint on found materials in refugee housing, illustrate in bomb shelters, photograph their shelled cities wearing press passes and bulletproof jackets. They document, create, and share. They post their daily journals and images on social media. They perform at the Grammy Awards. They know their message is powerful, and the amplification of their voices is critical for victory in a very real battle for survival.\r\n\r\nCurated by Grace Mahoney (U-M Slavic Languages and Literatures) and Jessica Zychowicz, Ph.D. (Fulbright Ukraine and U-M Alumna), \"'I have a crisis for you': Women Artists of Ukraine Respond to War\" showcases work created by women artists in response to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The involved artists are painters, photographers, filmmakers, poets, translators, and textile artists. Many of the works exhibited demonstrate a continuity of engagement by the artists with the topic of war, especially since 2014 when the people of Ukraine gathered in a \u201cRevolution of Dignity\u201d against attempts by the Russian Federation to control the country\u2019s independence resulting in Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and backing of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east. \r\n\r\nThe featured artists have also been selected because of their prominent interest and exploration of issues relating to gender in their works. The title for this exhibit comes from a poem of the same name by Lyuba Yakimchuk:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014 our love\u2019s gone missing, I explain to a friend/ it vanished in one of the wars/ we waged in our kitchen/ \u2014 change the word \u2018war\u2019 to \u2018crisis,\u2019 he suggests/ because a crisis is something everyone has from time to time.\u201d\r\n\r\nLike in Yakimchuk\u2019s poem, many of these artists approach the war with personal perspectives. They intertwine, juxtapose, and disrupt experiences of war with the intimacies of personal relationships, the workings interior lives, and perceptions of social roles. The featured artworks and documents engage a range of subjects from women volunteering as combatants to the processes of grieving and reflect ongoing discourses in Ukrainian feminist scholarship. \r\n\r\nThe exhibit will be accompanied by a companion website which includes an expanded set of informational and aid-related resources. \r\n\r\n\"'I have a crisis for you': Women Artists of Ukraine Respond to War\" is hosted by the University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Research on Women and Gender (IRWG) and the Department of Women\u2019s and Gender Studies with co-sponsorship from the Center for Russian, East European & Eurasian Studies, the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, the Museum Studies Program, the Weiser Center for Europe and Eurasia, and the Weiser Center

University of Michigan is a public mural project and exhibition by Brooklyn-based street artist, painter, and activist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition* Pressed Against My Own Glass* will be installed in the Institute for the Humanities Gallery. In this multimedia installation on Black womanhood within the home space, Fazlalizadeh explores her childhood and adulthood within the domestic space and how it connects to the experiences of other Black women and those who had a girlhood. Using paintings, drawings, video, and reappropriated home objects, she examines her experiences of joy, rest, sadness, and fellowship in the home. While doing so, she makes connections to her Black women peers, even those like Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson who show how racist violence is a threat to Black women even in their homes.\r\n\r\nAbout the Public Mural Project:\r\n\r\n*To Be Heard*, public mural project, September 28-October 16, 2022. Locations: Angell Hall, Trotter Multicultural Center, Modern Languages Building, Shapiro Library.\r\n\r\nThe public mural component utilizes community engagement, public art, and social practice to listen to and amplify the voices of marginalized groups, particularly women and non-white students at the University of Michigan. Through class workshops and interviews, Fazlalizadeh will engage with Black and brown, queer, and women-identified students on the ways that they experience race and gender on campus, exploring how students are treated based on their identities.

Implementing machine learning, however, requires users to have programming skills. This can be a daunting challenge for many non-tech savvy researchers. This course aims to guide social scientists to explore how machine learning can be used for their research without learning how to code. This course uses a graphical user interface tool Orange to provide learners with hands-on experiences in implementing machine learning techniques including data cleaning, visualization, and fine-tuning of algorithmic models. The open-source tool Orange is built on popular Python packages, providing basically the same functions and performances as many data scientists would obtain by writing complicated code. The course demonstrates that researchers can utilize the power of machine learning without learning how to code and focus more on machine learning concepts and best practices as well as analytical model development and validation.\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: You must have your own laptop or desktop with Orange installed to participate in this class. For installation instruction of Orange, see https://orangedatamining.com/\r\n\r\nNot for academic credit.\r\n\r\nInstructor: Jinseok Kim\r\n\r\nAll 2022 courses will be held in an alternative format.", "occurrence_notes": "Registration and payment required.", "guid": "95713-21790777@events.umich.edu", "permalink": "http://events.umich.edu/event/95713", "building_id": "", "building_name": "Off Campus Location", "building_official_id": null, "campus_maps_id": "1", "room": "", "location_name": "Virtual", "has_livestream": 0, "cost": "Fees are based upon the total number of course hours, or webinars, selected.", "tags": ["Anthropology", "Data", "Data Curation", "Data Management", "Data Science", "Economics", "Graduate and Professional Students", "Health Data", "Information and Technology", "Mathematics", "Political Science", "Psychology", "Research", "Sociology", "Survey Research"], "website": "https://si.isr.umich.edu/", "links": [{"type": "other", "url": "https://si.isr.umich.edu/", "title": "Summer Institute in Survey Research Techniques"}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://si.isr.umich.edu/course-offerings/schedule/", "title": "Schedule"}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://si.isr.umich.edu/course-offerings/description-of-courses/", "title": "Course Descriptions"}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://si.isr.umich.edu/registration/processing/", "title": "Cost"}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://si.isr.umich.edu/registration/application/", "title": "Registration"}], "sponsors": [{"group_name": "Summer Institute in Survey Research Techniques", "group_id": "4327", "website": ""}, {"group_name": "Institute for Social Research", "group_id": "3285", "website": "http://isr.umich.edu"}], "image_url": "", "image_description": "", "styled_images": {"event_thumb": "", "event_large": "", "event_large_2x": "", "event_large_lightbox": "", "group_thumb": "", "group_thumb_square": "", "group_large": "", "group_large_lightbox": "", "event_large_crop": "", "event_list": "", "event_list_2x": "", "event_grid": "", "event_grid_2x": "", "event_feature_large": "", "event_feature_thumb": ""}, "occurrence_count": 5, "first_occurrence": 21790774}, {"id": "97342-21794360", "datetime_modified": "20220824T111922", "datetime_start": "20220928T100000", "datetime_end": "20220928T210000", "has_end_time": 1, "date_start": "2022-09-28", "date_end": "2022-09-28", "time_start": "10:00:00", "time_end": "21:00:00", "time_zone": "America/Detroit", "event_title": "Kristina Sheufelt: Here Nor There", "occurrence_title": "", "combined_title": "Kristina Sheufelt: Here Nor There: RC Art Gallery Fall 2022", "event_subtitle": "RC Art Gallery Fall 2022", "event_type": "Exhibition", "event_type_id": "7", "description": "Reception: Friday, September 9th, 5-7 pm.

Cheboiganing (Burt Lake) Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians who were violently burned from their land in Northern Michigan on October 15, 1900. Written across the walls above and around the memorial, a statement proclaims Anishinaabe rights to the land we stand on: \u201cYou are on Anishinaabe Land.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n \nPresented alongside are paintings of imagined decolonized landscapes and a symbolic cache of provisions.

In creating Flint Is Family In Three Acts, I see the role of photographs as empowering and enacting visible change: in Act I, the photographs bear witness and reclaim history; in Act II, the photographs reveal a hidden narrative; in Act III, the photographs are a catalyst for obtaining resources.\u201d\n\u2014LaToya Ruby Frazier \nFlint Is Family In Three Acts is a multi-part exhibition by renowned artist LaToya Ruby Frazier. For five years, Frazier researched and collaborated with two poets, activists, mothers and residents of Flint, Michigan, Shea Cobb and Amber Hasan, as they endured one of the most devastating ecological crises in U.S. history. Resulting in a monumental oeuvre of photographs, video, and texts Frazier developed Flint Is Family In Three Acts (2016-2021) to advocate for access to clean and safe drinking water for all regardless of race, religion and economic status. The series records stories of surviving and thriving, especially within racialized and marginalized neighborhoods in Flint, to ensure that they remained visible in national debates concerning environmental justice. Drawing inspiration from the urgency in Frazier\u2019s work, which also sheds light on building equitable and inclusive futures, Stamps Gallery, part of the Penny W. Stamps School of Art &amp; Design at the University of Michigan, initiated a partnership with the Flint Institute of Arts and the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University to bring this important exhibition together for the first time in Michigan. As co-presenters of this landmark exhibition, our goal is to offer a creative pedagogical platform that reaches broader audiences across Michigan and beyond - Flint is Family: Act I (2016-2017) will take place at the Flint Institute of Arts, Act II (2017-2019) at the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, and Act III (2019) at Stamps Gallery. The exhibition served as a catalyst to bring three disparate institutions together to deepen our understanding of individual and institutional agency in advocating for equity, transparency and environmental justice in our respective communities, while also highlighting the role of the artist as an agent for enacting positive social change.\n\nCurated by Srimoyee Mitra, Tracee Glab, and Steven L.

Water is a life force, without it humanity will cease to exist. Fresh water is necessary for the survival of all living organisms on Earth. The human body is made up of over 60% water and humanity cannot survive without it. Water is a vital life source that holds (and generates) power. It is nourishing, quenching, and refreshing but has also been commodified, polluted, and politicized. From the Standing Rock, Leech Lake and Fond du Lac reservations, to the straits of Mackinac where oil pipelines threaten important waterways, to the polluted Mississippi River and drying Colorado River Basin, to water shutoffs in Detroit, PFAs in Ann Arbor, and the Flint Water crisis (to name just a few), ensuring access to clean water (and the sustainable ecologies it supports) is an ongoing struggle that requires intersectional, intergenerational, and collective knowledge sharing, discussion and action to protect. \nCall for Work\nStamps Gallery invites the undergraduate and graduate students of Penny W. Stamps School of Art &amp; Design to participate in a poster and video exhibition that responds to the prompt: The care, sustainability, and access to free and clean water is arguably one of the most urgent and challenging issues of our time \u201cWhat can you do to spread awareness of water issues and conservation measures?\u201d\nEligible students: submit your work using our online form by Friday, August 19, 2022 \u2192\nEligibility\nMust be a currently enrolled undergraduate or graduate major in the Penny W. Stamps School of Art &amp; Design.Eligible students may submit one work (poster or video).Time-based work must be submitted as a YouTube/Vimeo link.Timeline\nThe deadline for submitting work is Friday, August 19, 2022, 5pm, EST. A selection committee composed of students, faculty, and Stamps Gallery staff will review submitted work in the weeks following the deadline.Students whose works are selected will be notified by September 2, 2022. The exhibition will take place from September 15, 2022 - January 14, 2023.Why posters &amp; videos? \nPosters can function as catalysts for change. For generations, posters have served as an effective tool to circulate ideas and messages to the public. Visually striking, and designed to draw attention from passersby, posters can be conversation starters, invite people to pause, reflect, spread the word, get involved. They have been a powerful medium for many conceptual artists and graphic designers to create powerful images and messages that could respond to immediate issues and be distributed widely. Similarly, video art was another exciting immediate medium for conceptual artists in the 1960s and 1970s as the technology became more accessible to the masses. Video art provided an alternative to the dominant broadcasting corporations. Artists made experimental films, recorded performances, and first-person narratives that were then exhibited and screened at galleries, museums, and events. Posters and videos continue to be salient features in the 21st Century to respond to urgent issues and questions facing the present moment. \nContext\nStamps Gallery is an incubator and lab for contemporary artists and designers to explore ideas and projects that catalyze positive social change. As the pandemic grips our nation it has exposed the social, political, and economic disparities that have disproportionately impacted Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. The world witnessed in horror and sadness the meaningless loss of African American lives with George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, among many others that we will never know. National and international outcries brought people together from multiple races, genders, and generations - on social media and in the streets - to publicly demand an end to police brutality, structural racism, and emphasizing that Black Lives Matter. What is the role of a university gallery in this time of crisis? How can we foster an inclusive platform for the students in our community to voice their ideas and foster a community based on equality, belonging, respect? We launched Respond/ Resist/ Rethink in the fall 2020 to kick off the fall semester with student work paired with the work of leading artists exhibiting at the Gallery.", "occurrence_notes": null, "guid": "96386-21792386@events.umich.edu", "permalink": "http://events.umich.edu/event/96386", "building_id": "", "building_name": "Off Campus Location", "building_official_id": null, "campus_maps_id": "1", "room": "", "location_name": "Stamps Gallery, 201 South Division Street Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104", "has_livestream": 0, "cost": "", "tags": ["Art"], "website": "https://stamps.umich.edu/events/respond-resist-rethink-2022", "links": [{"type": "other", "url": "https://stamps.umich.edu/events/respond-resist-rethink-2022", "title": null}], "sponsors": [{"group_name": "Penny W Stamps School of Art & Design", "group_id": "3157", "website": "http://stamps.umich.edu/"}], "image_url": "https://events.umich.edu/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96386_original-1.jpg", "image_description": "Penny W.

Choices about which artists you see in our galleries, choices about what relevant facts we share about the works, and choices about what - out of an infinite number of options - we don\u2019t say about them.\n \nPieces in this exhibition were made at a time when the world came to be shaped by the ideologies of colonial expansion and Western domination. And yet, that history and the stories of those marginalized do not readily appear in the still lives and portraits on display here. By grappling with what is visible and what remains hidden, we are forced to examine whose stories and histories are prioritized and why.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nIn this online exhibition, you can explore our efforts to deeply question the Museum\u2019s collection and our own past complicity in favoring colonial voices. In the Museum gallery, which will open in early 2021, you\u2019ll be able to experience the changes we\u2019re making to the physical space to highlight a more honest version of European and American history.\u00a0\n \nBy challenging our own practice, and continuing to add to what we know and what we write about the works we display, UMMA tells a more complex and more complete story of this nation - one that unsettles, and fails to settle for, simple narratives.\u00a0\n \n\u201cInvisible things are not necessarily \u2018not there\u2019....

Museum visitors can begin to explore this investigation online and in-person in Fall 2021.\n\nLead support for the UMMA exhibition\u00a0Wish You Were Here: African Art and Restitution\u00a0is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Michigan Arts and Culture Council.", "occurrence_notes": null, "guid": "84307-21623078@events.umich.edu", "permalink": "http://events.umich.edu/event/84307", "building_id": "1000151", "building_name": "Museum of Art", "building_official_id": 1000151, "campus_maps_id": "11", "room": "ArtGym", "location_name": "Museum of Art", "has_livestream": 0, "cost": "", "tags": ["Africa", "Art", "Exhibition", "History", "Museum", "Research", "UMMA"], "website": "https://umma.umich.edu/exhibitions/2021/wish-you-were-here-african-art-and-restitution", "links": [{"type": "other", "url": "https://umma.umich.edu/exhibitions/2021/wish-you-were-here-african-art-and-restitution", "title": null}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ummamuseum/", "title": null}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://www.instagram.com/ummamuseum/", "title": null}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://twitter.com/ummamuseum", "title": null}], "sponsors": [{"group_name": "University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA)", "group_id": "1177", "website": "http://www.umma.umich.edu/"}], "image_url": "https://events.umich.edu/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "image_description": "Wish You Were Here: African Art and Restitution", "styled_images": {"event_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_large_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_large_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_large_lightbox": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_large_lightbox/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "group_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "group_thumb_square": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_thumb_square/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "group_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "group_large_lightbox": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_large_lightbox/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_large_crop": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_large_crop/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_list": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_list/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_list_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_list_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_grid": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_grid/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_grid_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_grid_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_feature_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_feature_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg", "event_feature_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_feature_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_84307_original-7.jpg"}, "occurrence_count": 81, "first_occurrence": 21623078}, {"id": "88202-21650957", "datetime_modified": "20220928T181656", "datetime_start": "20220928T110000", "datetime_end": "20220928T170000", "has_end_time": 1, "date_start": "2022-09-28", "date_end": "2022-09-28", "time_start": "11:00:00", "time_end": "17:00:00", "time_zone": "America/Detroit", "event_title": "You Are Here", "occurrence_title": "", "combined_title": "You Are Here", "event_subtitle": "", "event_type": "Exhibition", "event_type_id": "7", "description": "Welcome back to the museum. We\u2019ve missed you.\n \nOn March 16, 2020, we closed our doors, just six days after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. We didn\u2019t know for how long. At that point there were twelve confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washtenaw County. We weren\u2019t wearing masks because we didn\u2019t fully understand how the virus is transmitted. We reopened to the public 488 days later, on June 17, 2021. While it is exciting to be together again and to see the world slowly reopen, we are also deeply impacted by what we\u2019ve been through. This exhibition holds both of those feelings.\n \nThe works of art in this show were selected because you really need to experience them in person, to be immersed in their textures, patterns, colors, and ideas. The exhibition is designed to remind visitors to be present where they are: to look and feel and be at UMMA, in person at the museum. It also reminds visitors where they aren\u2019t: at home, isolated, connecting with each other virtually.\u00a0\n \nThe centerpiece of the exhibition\u2014Kehinde Wiley\u2019s portrait of Keshawn Warren standing in front of a vibrant floral background\u2014exemplifies the idea of being present in oneself. Elsewhere you\u2019ll find experiences for all of your senses. Come visit and play the Harry Bertoia sound sculpture to announce your presence in the gallery. After all, you are here.\n\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by Lizzie and Jonathan\u00a0Tisch\u00a0and\u00a0the University of Michigan Office of the Provost.\n\u00a0", "occurrence_notes": null, "guid": "88202-21650957@events.umich.edu", "permalink": "http://events.umich.edu/event/88202", "building_id": "1000151", "building_name": "Museum of Art", "building_official_id": 1000151, "campus_maps_id": "11", "room": "Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Apse", "location_name": "Museum of Art", "has_livestream": 0, "cost": "", "tags": ["Art", "Exhibition", "Museum", "UMMA"], "website": "https://umma.umich.edu/exhibitions/2021/you-are-here", "links": [{"type": "other", "url": "https://umma.umich.edu/exhibitions/2021/you-are-here", "title": null}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/ummamuseum/", "title": null}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://www.instagram.com/ummamuseum/", "title": null}, {"type": "other", "url": "https://twitter.com/ummamuseum", "title": null}], "sponsors": [{"group_name": "University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA)", "group_id": "1177", "website": "http://www.umma.umich.edu/"}], "image_url": "https://events.umich.edu/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "image_description": "Photo by UMMA Staff\n", "styled_images": {"event_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_large_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_large_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_large_lightbox": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_large_lightbox/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "group_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "group_thumb_square": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_thumb_square/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "group_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "group_large_lightbox": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_large_lightbox/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_large_crop": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_large_crop/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_list": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_list/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_list_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_list_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_grid": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_grid/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_grid_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_grid_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_feature_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_feature_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg", "event_feature_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_feature_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_88202_original-3.jpg"}, "occurrence_count": 189, "first_occurrence": 21650957}, {"id": "99056-21797507", "datetime_modified": "20220928T183323", "datetime_start": "20220928T120000", "datetime_end": "20220928T130000", "has_end_time": 1, "date_start": "2022-09-28", "date_end": "2022-09-28", "time_start": "12:00:00", "time_end": "13:00:00", "time_zone": "America/Detroit", "event_title": "Become A Teacher - Info Session on Immediate High School Openings in Brooklyn, NY", "occurrence_title": "", "combined_title": "Become A Teacher - Info Session on Immediate High School Openings in Brooklyn, NY", "event_subtitle": "", "event_type": "Careers / Jobs", "event_type_id": "2", "description": "Achievement First is a charter network in the northeast focused on fostering strong students and strong teachers. \n\nWe're hiring for two immediate roles in Brooklyn, NY (Math & History teacher) and we'd loveto tell you more about our school and answer your questions about the role.

This formal, largely guided, practice utilizes evidence based cognitive training that bolsters our ability to handle stress, poor mood, and threat.  This weekly mindfulness practice encourages present moment, non-judgemental awareness \u2013 noticing where your focus and attention is and continually inviting attention to current mind and body sensations in a kind and compassionate way. Mindfulness meditation practice opens the possibility to pause, gain perspective, discern what is actually present and respond accordingly. In our ever-changing, complex, and challenging world, mindfulness can provide grounding and a framework to support a more skillful approach to navigating the demands of being human. As one form of contemplative practice, mindfulness meditation can support practitioners to build resilience and take compassionate action in the world.  \r\n \r\nWhether you are new to mindfulness meditation or are an experienced practitioner, each session is designed to offer guidance and support to assist you.", "occurrence_notes": null, "guid": "96537-21797227@events.umich.edu", "permalink":

Workshop participants learn how to conceptualize the life cycle of a project using human-centered design and backwards modelling when planning their projects to better understand how to version, archive, and preserve their research projects. Throughout the series, thematic questions around sustainability, preservation, accessibility, privacy, consent, grant requirements, and teaching with research will be examined.

What\u2019s the purpose of these complex structures in nature, and can we utilize similar mechanisms to program new functions in metamaterials?  In this talk, we will start from the perspective of geometric frustration, to explore answers to these questions.

Wade, faculty, students, staff, and administrators have spoken out about the importance of abortion access for members of the Michigan community. These supporters join a long lineage of advocates for reproductive freedom on campus, many of whom worked tirelessly to make abortion accessible under Michigan\u2019s 1931 abortion ban. But how exactly did the university act to support students, faculty, and staff seeking abortion services pre-Roe? \r\n\r\nRianna Johnson-Levy, a joint Ph.D. student in History and Women\u2019s and Gender Studies, will lead an exploration of how supportive counselors and university administrators worked to ensure safe, legal access to abortion for those under their care in late 1960s and early 1970s. \r\n\r\nMs. Johnson-Levy spent the summer combing through resources and collections of the Bentley Historical Library to uncover what U-M did to help students pre-Roe, including facilitating interstate travel and working with pro-choice clergy. The findings of her research have been compiled into a report, which offers critical lessons for the University in the post-Dobbs, post-Roe moment. \r\n\r\nRianna Johnson-Levy will present the report, followed by a discussion with U-M\u2019s Dean of Students, Dr. Laura Blake Jones, and CAPS Associate Director of Community Engagement and Outreach, Dr. Christine Asidao. The discussion will be moderated by Dr. Anna Kirkland, the Kim Lane Scheppele Collegiate Professor of Women\u2019s and Gender Studies, with time for Q&A with the audience.\r\n\r\nThis event is presented by IRWG, in collaboration with the U-M Post-Roe Campus Community Working Group.\r\n\r\nThis event will be presented in-person with an option to watch the livestream on Zoom.

Her work is rooted in community engagement and the public sphere. She makes site specific work that considers how people, particularly women, queer folks, and Black and brown people, experience race and gender within their surrounding environments \u2013 from the sidewalk to retail stores, and from church to college campuses. \nCurrently, Fazlalizadeh is Artist in Residence at the UM Institute for the Humanities where her exhibition Pressed Against My Own Glass is on view. During her residency, she will produce a public mural To Be Heard as a community engagement project in order to hear and amplify the voices of marginalized groups on the ways that they experience race and gender on campus, exploring how others engage with them based upon their identities. \nFazlalizadeh will discuss her methodology and cover her most well known works such as Stop Telling Women to Smile, the international street art series addressing gender based street harassment, and America is Black, a series of portrait and text pieces that explore and amplify the stories of non-White people in the United States. \nFazlalizadeh is from Oklahoma City, born to a Black mother and Iranian father. In 2018, she became the inaugural Public Artist in Residence for the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The impact of Fazlalizadeh&#039;s work spread to popular culture when she collaborated with director Spike Lee to base all of the artwork featured in his Netflix series, She&#039;s Gotta Have It, on her work. She also served as the show&#039;s art consultant. In 2020, Tatyana&#039;s debut book, Stop Telling Women to Smile: Stories of Street Harassment and How We&#039;re Taking Back Our Power, was released by Seal Press. She has appeared in the New York Times, NPR, the New Yorker, and Time Magazine and has lectured about her work at Brooklyn Museum, New Orleans Contemporary Art Center, as well as several schools including Brown, Pratt, Stanford, and The New School. Her work has been exhibited at museums such as Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and is in the collection of institutions including the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.\nPressed Against My Own Glass is on view at the Institute for the Humanities Gallery from September 15 - October , 2022", "occurrence_notes": null, "guid": "96586-21792912@events.umich.edu", "permalink": "http://events.umich.edu/event/96586", "building_id": "", "building_name": "Off Campus Location", "building_official_id": null, "campus_maps_id": "1", "room": "", "location_name": "Rackham Amphitheatre", "has_livestream": 0, "cost": "", "tags": ["Art"], "website": "https://stamps.umich.edu/events/to-be-heard-public-art-interventions", "links": [{"type": "other", "url": "https://stamps.umich.edu/events/to-be-heard-public-art-interventions", "title": null}], "sponsors": [{"group_name": "Penny W Stamps School of Art & Design", "group_id": "3157", "website": "http://stamps.umich.edu/"}], "image_url": "https://events.umich.edu/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "image_description": "large mural on a red brick wall of 4 black women in black and white", "styled_images": {"event_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_large_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_large_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_large_lightbox": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_large_lightbox/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "group_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "group_thumb_square": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_thumb_square/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "group_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "group_large_lightbox": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/group_large_lightbox/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_large_crop": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_large_crop/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_list": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_list/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_list_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_list_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_grid": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_grid/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_grid_2x": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_grid_2x/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_feature_large": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/resolve/event_feature_large/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg", "event_feature_thumb": "https://events.umich.edu/media/cache/event_feature_thumb/media/attachments/2022/08/event_96586_original-1.jpg"}, "occurrence_count": 1, "first_occurrence": 21792912}, {"id": "97716-21794999", "datetime_modified": "20220830T115132", "datetime_start": "20220928T174500", "datetime_end": "20220928T184500", "has_end_time": 1, "date_start": "2022-09-28", "date_end": "2022-09-28", "time_start": "17:45:00", "time_end": "18:45:00", "time_zone": "America/Detroit", "event_title": "Business+Tech Literacy Download: Tech in Agriculture & Food", "occurrence_title": "", "combined_title": "Business+Tech Literacy Download: Tech in Agriculture & Food", "event_subtitle": "", "event_type": "Workshop / Seminar", "event_type_id": "21", "description": "AgTech is a growing and exciting field.
